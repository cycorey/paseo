# Release

All workspaces share one version and release together.

## Standard release (patch)

```bash
npm run release:patch
```

This bumps the version across all workspaces, runs checks, publishes to npm, and pushes the branch + tag (triggering desktop, APK, and EAS mobile workflows).

If asked to "release paseo" without specifying major/minor, treat it as a patch release.

## Manual step-by-step

```bash
npm run version:all:patch    # Bump version, create commit + tag
npm run release:check        # Validate release
npm run release:publish      # Publish to npm
npm run release:push         # Push HEAD + tag (triggers CI workflows)
```

## Draft release flow

```bash
npm run draft-release:patch    # Bump, push tag, create draft GitHub Release
npm run release:finalize       # Publish npm, promote draft to published
```

- `draft-release:patch` creates the GitHub Release as a draft so desktop assets, APK uploads, and synced notes attach to it
- `release:finalize` publishes npm and promotes the same draft release
- Use the same semver tag for both; don't cut a second tag

## Notes

- `version:all:*` bumps root + syncs workspace versions and `@getpaseo/*` dependency versions
- `release:prepare` refreshes workspace `node_modules` links to prevent stale types
- If `release:publish` partially fails, re-run it — npm skips already-published versions
- Website Mac download CTA URL derives from `packages/website/package.json` version at build time

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with user-facing release notes (features, fixes — not refactors)
- [ ] `npm run release:patch` completes successfully
- [ ] GitHub `Desktop Release` workflow for the `v*` tag is green
- [ ] GitHub `Android APK Release` workflow for the same tag is green
- [ ] EAS `release-mobile.yml` workflow for the same tag is green
